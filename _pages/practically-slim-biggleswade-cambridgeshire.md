Hi, I&#8217;m Teresa, Regional Director for Cambridgeshire & Biggleswade

I&#8217;m passionate about supporting and motivating my clients, whilst offering direction and focus in order for them to achieve their goals. I enjoy working with clients to help them reach their full potential, by giving them the tools to move forward in their lives. I understand that each client comes with a unique story and set of experiences. I respect each client by utilising a unique combination of therapies to unlock the greatest potential for healing, transformation and growth. I believe in enabling the individual to find the power to be the person that they want to be by providing insightful, supportive and goal-oriented therapy.

I&#8217;ve battled with my own body image and weight since I was a teenager, even when I wasn&#8217;t overweight! I understand how it feels to be overweight and lack confidence in your body; I personally lost 5sts in 18 weeks on a Very Low Calorie Diet after having had children and a stressful divorce.

I am a weight management professional, and have practiced in this area for over 15 years. I am a fully qualified Integrative Counsellor, with a BTec Certficate in Weight Management & TA101. I believe that the ultimate goal is keeping the weight off by adapting to a different, more peaceful relationship to food and your body. My approach is to meet you where you are and to help to move you toward your goals.

Practically Slim is unique, as it offers bespoke plans to suit your needs and personal psychology. We do not squeeze you into a &#8216;one size fits all&#8217; framework. You can also decide whether you&#8217;d like to join small groups, just come for weekly weigh ins; or have one-to-one sessions.

No need to struggle on your own, no need to put it off any longer. Take the next step on your journey by contacting me and arranging a time to meet. Using your Personality Profile Map we can tailor a bespoke plan that suits you, and is the best way to make your goals achievable.
