I am an **Astrologer** and **Tarot reader.**

 ![Teresa Picture](https://www.astroshola.co.uk/assets/img/avatar.png)

I first became interested in astrology, starting with Sun sign books when I was 11 years old. It is a fascinating subject, I never stop learning as there is always something more to discover and explore.

I have studied with the Faculty of Astrological Studies, Horary with Richard Swatton, The London School of Astrology and have a Diploma in counselling. I have certificates for Tarot reading from the Aquila Lodge, Sun Sign School Tarot course and Being a Sun Sign Astrologer.

As part of my Lifestyle coaching, I offer holistic intuitive coaching sessions to explore your personal astrology map.  This allows us to look into certain aspects of your chart, including the myths and characteristics of the planets and how they manifest for you. This can be combined with a Tarot reading.

I am chairperson of Bedford astrology club, which meets on the second Friday of each month. We are a friendly group who welcome new members.
