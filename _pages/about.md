I have many years of experience in Weight Management enabling hundreds of clients to achieve their weight goals. I offer one to one coaching and groups, combined with your choice from the [PracticallySlim](www.PracticallySlim.com) plans.

I first became interested in astrology, starting with Sun sign books when I was 11 years old. It is a fascinating subject, I never stop learning as there is always something more to discover and explore.

Your astrology chart is a *roadmap* of your potential in life, what turns you take on the road are your decisions! Astrology can help you identify how you can flow with your natural talents, when you need to change direction or do things differently.

As part of my Lifestyle coaching, that can cover any area of life  I offer holistic intuitive coaching sessions to explore your personal astrology map.  This allows us to look into certain aspects of your chart, including the myths and characteristics of the planets and how they manifest for you. I also offer Tarot readings.

What is happening for you now and how to make the most of times of positive opportunity. We can look at any themes that show up in your chart that may be causing difficulties for you in your life at the present time. As a counsellor & coach I also offer Emotional Freedom Technique.

I am chairperson of Bedford astrology club, which meets on the second Friday of each month.
