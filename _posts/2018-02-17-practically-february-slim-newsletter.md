Finding Your February Focus
===========================

Hi everyone,


I do love the New Year and the enthusiasm for projects, change and personal development but inevitably the cold, hard truth that some of this is hard work reveals itself in the long dark days of February as the excitement wears off and size of the task ahead reveals itself. And so it is with weight loss too. There's no escaping this fact. But there are things that can be done to keep up your motivation.  

In Valentine's Week remember that loving yourself is just as important as loving others. Remember to praise and reward yourself for your progress so far. Your rewards can be simple - buying a magazine, trying on clothes that were too small, calling a friend you've not spoken to in a while or just asking Alexa to play your favourite tune!

Also when a job seems too big, break it down into chunks. If you have 5stone to lose it can seem like too much but each half stone is easier to focus on and can be a place to celebrate. These occasions will come round relatively quickly as you lose the weight with Practically Slim.  

And turn your focus to the positive. What I'm talking about here is using what many people call the Law of Attraction. This basically states that what we focus on will happen - yes even the negative stuff. If you keep telling yourself "I don't want to gain weight" guess what happens - you're focus is gaining weight. And if you don't believe this, just remember the times you've told you're children not to get dirty or not to spill their drink on clean clothes. Nine times out ten they do exactly what you've told them not to do because you have directed their focus to that action.

Directing your focus to yourself, to small tasks that make the bigger job complete itself and being positive in your intentions help you with motivation. And of course your weekly weigh-in with your Practically Slim Coach is important too even when, or perhaps especially when, you have a difficult week. We're here to help you get past the difficult bits in your weight loss journey and to celebrate your success too.  

Call me if you need a little help with your February focus.  

best wishes,

Food Fad Fails
==============

At this time of year the press and media are full of what you should and shouldn't eat. Are you, like us, getting just a tiny bit tired of the faddy food fables out there? Or maybe you struggle to cut the claptrap? We tell it like it really is.

![](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/bafed77a939c1efbcf500d929/images/b9340d64-da0f-41e3-80be-e2df1009165c.jpg)

**Fake news**

Just because he’s paranoid doesn’t mean they’re not out to get him. Similarly, the lead balloon nature of The Donald’s concept of fake news doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. Fake food news pushed down our throats includes things like:

*   Clean eating. What is it? It’s nonsense. Fuel your body with healthy options and ignore the suggestion that this is only something for filthy foodies
*   Coconut oil. Tasty but, you know what? It’s fat. It’s not a mouthwash. Or a sexual lubricant. Try unsaturated rapeseed oil instead. It’s cheaper and healthier. (Although toothpaste might be useful too)
*   Detox. You have this thing called, errm, a liver .... It cleans things up for you. It makes an expensive juicer and pints of curdled green mush redundant
*   Kale. Anything to encourage the kids to eat their greens. But cabbage will do. Honest
*   Low carb. Yes, people lose weight when they drop one of the food groups. Could this be because they’re just eating less? Eat a sensible, balanced diet including healthy carbs. Just watch your portion size
*   Ready-made meals. A lot have too much salt and sugar, agreed. But, guess what, we’ve moved on. Healthy versions abound. Women don’t have to be chained to the stove for us all to ‘eat healthily’. Read the labels and get a life.

**Eat this**

At Practically Slim we are not alone in getting a bit cheesy about all the myths. [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/18/angry-chef-debunking-detox-diets-wellness-nutrition-alternative-facts) reports Angry Chef Anthony Warner whipping himself into a frenzy about food fads. His new book debunks the lot. An entertaining Christmas read?

So – eat well and, if you want to lose weight, in moderation. You can do that whilst following the NHS’s [12 week diet guide](https://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/weight-loss-guide/Pages/losing-weight-getting-started.aspx). It’s not based on fake foody flim-flam but on research from The British Dietetics Association.

An evidence-based good, balanced diet includes:

*   at least five portions of fruit and veg a day
*   potatoes, bread, rice and pasta
*   dairy in moderation
*   some beans, pulses, fish, eggs, meat and other protein
*   unsaturated oils and spreads in small amounts.
*   And if you need a little help, have a look at the range of diets we offer to get you off to a flying start.

New Reports on "Ultra-processed" Foods
======================================

You might have seen reports on the links between ultra-processed or factory produced foods and cancer. This short article from the BBC outlines the summary from new research and of course these are the foods also linked to weight gain and obesity.  

[![](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/bafed77a939c1efbcf500d929/images/5c3032b7-6076-4ad1-b748-cee74cb8518d.png)](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-43064290?utm_content=bufferabf38&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer)  

What counts as ultra-processed

*   Mass-produced packaged breads and buns
*   Sweet or savoury packaged snacks including crisps
*   Chocolate bars and sweets
*   Sodas and sweetened drinks
*   Meatballs, poultry and fish nuggets
*   Instant noodles and soups
*   Frozen or shelf-life ready meals
*   Foods made mostly or entirely from sugar, oils and fats

Men Need To Lose Weight Too
===========================

![](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/bafed77a939c1efbcf500d929/images/cec86881-87f7-434b-b84a-043dd07d7720.jpg)  ![](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/bafed77a939c1efbcf500d929/images/6b7e6d0e-1c43-47cf-8ca1-551c233eaa5a.jpg)


It is increasingly true that men are neglecting their health. In the UK men are over-represented in obesity statistics yet fail to take action to reduce their weight using excuses like the one above. So even if you're not the size of the guy on the balcony, you don't need to wait until you are to take action.  

Men are susceptible to carrying extra weight around the midsection. Having excess fat in this area can lead to a number of health problems, such as type 2 Diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure. It is especially important for men to maintain a healthy weight to avoid such problems. Men can achieve fast and effective weight loss by making changes to their diet as well as regular exercise.  

At Practically Slim we will help you develop a custom habit plan, one that doesn't require a lot of time or effort to follow. Our expert coaches help you stay motivated to follow it, until it becomes second nature. Practically Slim helps you build healthier habits to lose weight and keep it off. Our programmes have helped men get results that have changed their lives and their health. You will feel better, look better, and you'll be amazed how your healthy choices will reinvigorate your self- esteem, your relationships, your career, and your future.
